# Automatic Stock Trading - Applied Reinforcement Learning Sommer Term 2023

Welcome to the repository for the practical course on Applied Reinforcement Learning, offered in the summer term of 2023 at the university. In this course, we explore the fascinating field of Reinforcement Learning and its application to stock trading. The course will be undertaken by a team of four talented students: Viktoria, Mohamad, Lorena, and Jonas.

## Project Overview

The primary focus of our project is to develop an intelligent agent that leverages historical data to make informed decisions regarding stock trading. Specifically, our agent will predict whether to **sell**, **hold**, or **buy a particular stock** based on the analysis of the available data. To accomplish this, we plan to implement advanced RL algorithms such as **Advantage Actor-Critic** (A2C) and **Proximal Policy Optimization** (PPO).

## Datasets and APIs

To facilitate our research and development process, we will utilize the following datasets and APIs:

1. **Yahoo!Finance:** This dataset will serve as our primary source of historical stock market data. It provides comprehensive and reliable information about stock prices, volumes, and various other relevant metrics. [Tutorial](https://algotrading101.com/learn/yahoo-finance-api-guide/)
2. **Alpha Vantage:** This API will supplement our analysis by providing additional financial data and metrics. We can leverage this data to enrich our models and potentially incorporate alternative data sources such as Twitter sentiment analysis.

## Add-Ons Ideas

In addition to the core implementation, we have identified several exciting add-on ideas that can further enhance our project. These include:

### Robo-advisor

To expand the capabilities of our agent, we propose integrating a robo-advisor component. This would involve combining historical stock market data with alternative data sources such as **Twitter sentiment analysis**. By considering these additional factors, our agent can better understand market dynamics and make more informed trading decisions. Additionally, we can **interact with the client to determine their risk preferences** and tailor the agent's behavior accordingly.

### Market Making

Incorporating the concept of market making, we can leverage the robo-advisor as a market maker. By **utilizing the Limit Order Book**, our agent can dynamically adjust buy and sell prices to create liquidity in the market. This approach can contribute to a more efficient and stable trading environment.

### Option Pricing and Hedging

To further extend the scope of our project, we propose exploring complex derivatives, such as options, to hedge risks associated with vanilla stock trading. By incorporating **option pricing and hedging strategies**, our agent can handle more sophisticated trading scenarios and provide a more comprehensive trading solution.
